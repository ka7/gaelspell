<h2>Summary</h2>
This page has been provided as an aid to package maintainers 
who are unable to read the 
<a href = "index.html"><i>ispell-gaeilge</i> home page</a>
which is entirely in Irish.    This is in no sense a translation of 
the Irish page (which contains much more detailed descriptions).

<p>
Two packages are available: <i>ispell-gaeilge</i>, which
provides Irish language support for Geoff Kuenning's
<a href = "http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html">
<i>International Ispell</i></a>, and 
<i>aspell-gaeilge</i> which does the same for Kevin Atkinson's
<a href = "http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">
<i>Aspell</i></a>.  The word lists are identical, just packaged differently.

<h2><a name="Features">Features</a></h2>

<ul>
<li> <b>Large Word List.</b>  There are around 300,000 words in the database,
around 15 times larger than the next largest Irish spellchecker.    The 
coverage is equivalent to a dictionary with around 26,000 headwords --
almost twice as big as a typical pocket dictionary (e.g. the Oxford or
the Collins Gem).
<li> <b>Grammatical Completeness.</b>  I have written software which 
generates every inflected form of a dictionary headword when provided
with a limited amount of grammatical information.   For instance,
by adding the word "iompaigh" to the underlying database 
as a second declension verb, about 80 inflected forms 
are added to the word list (all verb endings, prefixed d',h,n-, etc.)
<li> <b>Accuracy.</b>  The only absolute rule when generating a spellchecker
is that there should be no misspelled words in the basic word lists.
Every word has been checked against print sources at least once.
The software which generates the inflected forms has been tested various
ways, including through the use of the shell script "igcheck" 
which checks a word list
for letter combinations which are illegal or "pre-standard" in Irish.
The other word lists I've seen contain anywhere from 10% to 40% English or 
misspelled Irish words.
<li> <b>Frequent Updates.</b> I have provided major updates every six 
months or so since the initial release and plan to continue this for
the foreseeable future.   I spellcheck many of the articles from 
the online Irish language periodicals as a way of keeping up with the latest
terminology.  I have also been adding words from the terminology dictionaries
published by <i>An Gúm</i>.
<li> <b>Dialect support.</b>  The <i>ispell-gaeilge</i> package provides
a "large model" which includes many frequently-used but officially 
non-standard spellings.
<li> <b>Phonetic support (<i>aspell</i> only).</b>  The file 
<i>gaeilge_phonet.dat</i> provides a complete "coarse" encoding 
of the pronunciation of Irish.  This allows <i>aspell</i> to make more
intelligent suggestions when it comes across a misspelled word.  For instance,
where <i>ispell</i> gives no suggestions for the pre-standard "imfhiosach",
<i>aspell</i> uses the phonetics file to encode this as "*M*S*K",
thereby recognizing and suggesting the correct spelling "iomasach".
</ul>

<h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>
I am not an expert with <i>autoconfig</i> or <i>automake</i>
so the installation procedure is a bit naive.  There is no
"configure" script -- after unpacking the tarball, 
try using "make" to build the hashed word list
(<i>gaeilge.hash</i> for <i>ispell</i> and <i>gaeilge</i> for <i>aspell</i>).
If you run into trouble
you should edit the 
variables at the top of the
Makefile to the appropriate directories and try again.

<p>
The default hash table conforms strictly to standardized Irish spelling.
You can generate a "large model" table <i>gaeilgemor.hash</i> 
(<i>ispell</i> only) by changing the variable 
<i>INSTALLATION</i> at the top of the Makefile
to <i>gaeilgemor</i> and using "make" as before.  
<b>However I strongly urge installers to make the standard model 
<i>gaeilge.hash</i>
the default on your system</b>.   The large model is <b>not</b> the analogue
of the
larger-sized English dictionaries distributed with many English spellcheckers
(containing obscure but correctly-spelled words).  Instead it contains
non-standard or dialect spellings and non-standard inflections.

<p>
The ISO-639-1 code for Irish is "ga".

<h2><a name="Contributing">Contributing</a></h2>
<p>
Only a handful of people have corresponded with me about these packages
and no one has contributed any words.  Perhaps having an appeal in English
will inspire some learners to contribute.

<p>
As noted above, I have the software infrastructure in place so that if
someone sends me a list of "headwords" with grammatical information,
all inflected forms of the word will be added automatically.  This is a
much more efficient (and less error-prone) way of building up a good 
word list than by adding forms one by one into a personal dictionary.
