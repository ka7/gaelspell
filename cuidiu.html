<p>
Only a handful of people have corresponded with me about these packages
and no one has contributed any words.  Perhaps having an appeal in English
will inspire some learners to contribute.
</p>

<p>
GaelSpell development is hosted at 
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/gaelspell/">Google Code</a>.
There you'll find the source repository (going back to 2001), 
bug tracking system, and the project wiki.
</p>

<p>
I have the software infrastructure in place so that if
someone sends me a list of "headwords" with grammatical information,
all inflected forms of the word will be added automatically.  This is a
much more efficient (and less error-prone) way of building up a good 
word list than by adding forms one by one into a personal dictionary.
</p>

<p>
The word list already contains a large number of Irish personal names and
placenames, but these were not added in any systematic way, and there are
possibly quality issues.  If there is anyone with a particular interest
in this area that would like to help, please get in touch with me
at kscanne at gmail dot com.
